I help organizations understand and leverage their quantitative information. Whether it's data science, machine learning, or statistics; I enjoy making an impact and getting to solve real world problems.

I got my start working with [stage 1 start-ups][1] before moving on to contracting for [venture capital funds][2]. Now I lead the data science initiatives at [Widewail][6], a growing tech company located in the heart of Burlington, VT. I enjoy working in small teams where I can collaborate with people from various departments.

I got my bachelors degree in Mathematics from St. Lawrence University, where I did my thesis on the [Erdos-Faber-Lovasz conjecture][3]. After spending some time pursuing other interests[^1], I began working at a young startup where I was introduced to a range of topics in statistics and data analytics, but was primarily focused on using survival analysis to help predict customer churn. Later I went on to pursue my masters degree in Complex Systems and Data Science from the University of Vermont. While at UVM I got to work in the OCEAN lab studying [open source communities][7], and for my [thesis][8] I worked on analyzing dimensionality reduction techniques when applied to temporal networks. During my time researching I was advised by [Jim Bagrow][5]. For more details, check out my portfolio, or take a look at my [resume][4].

I currently reside in Essex, VT with my fiance and chihuahua.
