I help organizations understand and leverage their quantitative information. Call it what you will: data science, machine learning, or statistics; the modern technological world lies at the intersection of mathematics and computing, and that’s where I like to play.

I’ve worked with [stage 1 start-ups][1] and [venture capital funds][2], building models, establishing codebases, and providing mathematical expertise to developers. I mainly use R, but have experience in Python and SQL.

I have a bachelors degree in Mathematics from St. Lawrence University, where I did my thesis on the [Erdos-Faber-Lovasz conjecture][3]. After spending some time pursuing other interests[^1], I began working at a young startup where I got introduced to a range of topics in statistics and data analytics. I was primarily focused on using survival analysis to help predict customer churn, but I’m constantly trying to develop and learn new skills. I'm currently pursuing a masters degree in Complex Systems and Data Science from the University of Vermont. At UVM I work in the OCEAN lab studying open source communities advised by [Jim Bagrow][5]. For more details, check out my portfolio, or take a look at my [resume][4].

I currently reside in South Burlington, VT.
